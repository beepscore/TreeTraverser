# Purpose
Write Android app to traverse a binary tree.
Do this as a learning exercise.

## Background

### Problem statement
Write a method to check if a tree contains a node with a given value.

## Assumptions
Values are not necessarily sorted.

## Plan

### Depth first
Implement depth first recursive traverse.

### Breadth first
Alternative method. Implement breadth first traverse.
Use stack or queue.

## Tests
See tests for implemented behavior.
